# Public-data-visualisation
This project provides both real-time and historical analysis of Barcylays cycle stations (aka Borris bikes) within London.

The main structure is as follows:
-   nodeApp - the NodeJS backend application which provides both an API for the frontend and a process for grabbing / storing & processing station data
-   publicDataApp - the AngularJS frontend which acts as an MVC application
