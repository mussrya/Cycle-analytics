# Public-data-visulisation
This project provides both real-time and historical analysis of Barcylays cycle stations (aka Borris bikes) within London.

The main structure is as follows:
    nodeApp - the Node backend application which provides both an API for the frontend and a process for grabbing / storing & processing station data
    publicDataApp - the Angular frontend which acts as an MVC application
