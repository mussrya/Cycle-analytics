# Cycle-analytics
This project provides both real-time and historical analysis of Barclays cycle stations (aka Borris bikes) within London.

The main structure is as follows:
* nodeApp - the NodeJS backend, which is split into 2 seperate node servers:
 * API for the front-end application
 * Task runner for the grabbing, storing & processing of cycle station data
* publicDataApp - the AngularJS frontend which acts as the MVC application
